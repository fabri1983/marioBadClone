/**
 * This script will keep your desired aspect ratio, adding bars if needed.
 * http://gamedesigntheory.blogspot.ie/2010/09/controlling-aspect-ratio-in-unity.html
 * Set this script to your main camera.
 * The bars are shown as a second camera:
 * 	1. Create a camera
 *  2. Set the camera's depth value to -2 so it's rendered underneath the main camera (whose depth value defaults to -1).
 *  3. Set background to the desired color (black).
 *  4. Set the Clear Flags to "Solid Color", set the Culling Mask to "Nothing".
