// This simple shader will mask off areas of a texture. 
// This is useful for, say, when you really want to make your minimap round. 
// I've designed it with GUI elements in mind. To make a round object you would:
// 
//  - Put a black border around a white circle and import that into unity.
//  - Change the texture format to Alpha 8 bit and check "Build Alpha from Grayscale"
//  - Create a shader with the code below.
//  - Create a new plane and import your texture on to it.
//  - Select the shader you created.
//  - Drop your culling mask in to it. 
//
// Optimization for Mobile: avoid the use of alpha cut off (Alpha Test)
